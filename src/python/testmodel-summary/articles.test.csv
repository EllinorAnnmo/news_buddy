20 May 2021
North Carolina Representative Madison Cawthorn is drawing ire for violent responses to a social media post featuring Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar that said she supports “terror”.

The post, which was made on the encrypted messaging app Telegram on May 15, appears to reference support for Palestinians under Israeli occupation expressed by Omar and other members of the progressive “Squad,” including Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Cori Bush and Rashida Tlaib, whose family comes from Palestine.

“Far-left Democrats have chosen terrorism over tolerant freedom,” Cawthorn wrote in the post. “The Muslim Brotherhood is a purveyor of terror. Democrats are on the wrong side of history and it’s not even an argument.”

The post, which linked to an article featuring Omar, who was born in Somalia and went to the United States as a refugee, drew responses calling to put a “noose” on the Minnesota representative, according to the Asheville Citizen Times.

The post appears to have been since deleted.
Cawthorn, a Republican, is a stalwart supporter of former President Donald Trump. Many of Trump’s supporters have taken to encrypted chat apps like Telegram following Trump’s removal from Twitter, Facebook and other social media.

Cawthorn’s channel on Telegram was opened in February, a month after the January 6 storming of the US Capitol in an attempt to stop a joint session of Congress from certifying President Joe Biden’s electoral victory.

Telegram moderators did not respond to questions by the Asheville Citizen Times on their policies for removing posts.

Trump faced consistent criticism of Islamophobia over his term. One of his first acts was to issue an administrative order that came to be known as the “Muslim ban”, which blocked people from six predominately Muslim nations from travelling to the US. Many of his allies have faced similar accusations.

In April, House Democrats passed a bill preventing another “Muslim ban” from being enacted, making travel bans based on religion illegal."
CEO of TikTok's parent company steps down,Reuters,5/20/2021,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ceo-tiktoks-parent-company-steps-rcna983,"Zhang Yiming announced he will step down as CEO of TikTok-owner ByteDance, saying he lacked the social skills to be an ideal manager and naming his college roommate Liang Rubo as his successor to navigate a rising tide of Big Tech regulations.

In a surprise announcement to employees on Thursday, first reported by Reuters and later disclosed by the company, Zhang said the change would enable him ""to have greater impact on longer-term initiatives."" He will move to a ""key strategy"" position at the end of the year, ByteDance said.

The 38-year-old will be succeeded by Liang, a long-time colleague and the current head of human resources at ByteDance, one of the world's biggest private tech companies with an estimated value of about $300 billion in recent trades.

The management shake-up — ByteDance's biggest since its launch in 2012 — comes as Chinese regulators are increasing scrutiny of the country's biggest technology firms."
Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire comes into effect,Jeremy Bowen,5/21/2021,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-57195537,"A ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip appeared to be holding hours after coming into effect.

It began early on Friday, bringing to an end 11 days of fighting in which more than 250 people were killed, most of them in Gaza.

Both Israel and Hamas claimed victory in the conflict.

Fresh clashes broke out at the al-Aqsa mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem on Friday, testing the truce.

Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told AFP news agency that Palestinians had thrown stones at officers, and that ""riot"" suppressing measures had been taken in response.

But the ceasefire seemed to be holding on Friday night. Israel has temporarily opened a crossing into Gaza, allowing food, fuel and medicine into the territory. The country has also lifted emergency restrictions inside its own borders.

The ceasefire began early on Friday, bringing to an end 11 days of bombardment in which more than 240 people have died, most of them in Gaza.

Palestinians poured on to the streets of Gaza soon after the truce began, while a Hamas official warned that its hands ""are on the trigger"".

Both Israel and Hamas have claimed victory in the conflict.

US President Joe Biden said the ceasefire brought ""genuine opportunity"" for progress.

On Thursday, more than 100 Israeli air strikes targeted Hamas infrastructure in the north of Gaza. Militants launched more than 300 rockets towards Israel during the day, the Israeli military said.

The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained

The children who have died in the conflict
Fighting began in Gaza on 10 May after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in occupied East Jerusalem that culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes.

At least 232 people, including more than 100 women and children, have been killed in Gaza, according to its health ministry. Israel has said at least 150 militants are among those killed in Gaza. Hamas does not give casualty figures for fighters.

In Israel 12 people, including two children, have been killed, its medical service says. Israel says some 4,000 rockets have been fired towards its territory by militants in Gaza.

What have the two sides said?
The Israeli Political Security Cabinet said it had ""unanimously accepted the recommendation"" for a ceasefire.

""The political leaders emphasised that the reality on the ground will determine the future of the campaign,"" the statement said.

Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz said on Twitter that the Gaza offensive had yielded ""unprecedented military gains"".

A Hamas official told the Associated Press news agency that the ceasefire announced by Israel amounts to a ""victory"" for the Palestinian people and a defeat for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Soon after the ceasefire started at 02:00 on Friday (23:00 GMT Thursday), large numbers of Palestinians took to the streets of Gaza in cars and on foot to celebrate.

Loudspeakers from mosques pronounced ""the victory of the resistance achieved over the Occupation during the 'Sword of Jerusalem' battle"".

What is Hamas?
But Basem Naim, from the Hamas Council on International Relations, told the BBC he was sceptical about whether the truce would last.

""Without justice for Palestinians, without stopping the Israeli aggression and Israeli atrocities against our people in Jerusalem, the ceasefire will continue to be fragile,"" he said.

A member of Hamas's political bureau, Ezzat al-Reshiq, issued a warning to Israel.

""It's true that the battle ends today but Netanyahu and the whole world should know that our hands are on the trigger and we will continue to ramp up the capabilities of this resistance,"" he told the Reuters news agency.

""We tell Netanyahu and his army, if you come back, we will come back.""

Survivors are not claiming victory
Analysis box by Jeremy Bowen, Middle East editor
Just as in the other wars since Hamas took over in Gaza in 2007, the two sides are claiming victory.

A senior Hamas leader told the BBC in Gaza that Israel had promised to ""lift their hand off Sheikh Jarrah and Al-Aqsa Mosque"". He was referring to one of Islam's holiest mosques and the Jerusalem district which became a flashpoint during an attempt to evict Palestinian families from their homes.

Israel denied there was any such understanding. Benny Gantz, the defence minister, issued a statement saying that after the past 11 days Israel can show military achievements ""unprecedented in their scale and strategic significance for the struggle with terrorist organisations in Gaza"".

On both sides survivors and the bereaved from missiles and bombs are not claiming victory. By far the majority of the dead and injured are Palestinians in Gaza, which also suffered hundreds of millions of dollars of physical damage.

Both sides have also been crafting what is referred here sometimes as victory narratives.

It is the fourth big war between Israel and Hamas since the first one back in the end of 2008 and after each of those encounters, and all the smaller ones in between, similar things have been said by both sides in claiming victory and then essentially the seeds of the next conflict are sown. I can tell you one thing for certain - that if the status quo does not change favourably, there will be another round of this.

What did Biden say?
US President Joe Biden said he commended Mr Netanyahu in a phone call after the ceasefire agreement was announced.

He said the US - Israel's closest and most important ally - fully supports the country's ""right to defend itself against indiscriminate rocket attacks from Hamas and other Gaza-based terrorist groups that have taken the lives of innocent victims"".

Anthony Zurcher: The Democrats' 'tectonic' shift on the conflict
Mr Biden added that the Israeli prime minister shared his appreciation for Israel's US-backed defence system, known as the Iron Dome, ""which our nations developed together and which has saved the lives of countless Israeli citizens - both Arab and Jew"".

He also praised Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi for brokering the ceasefire, before turning to the human cost of the conflict.

""I send my sincere condolences to all the families, Israeli and Palestinian, who have lost loved ones and my hope for a full recovery for the wounded,"" he said.


media captionAsmaa AbuMezied: We’ve never known what a normal life is
The president said the US ""remains committed to working with the United Nations"" in providing humanitarian assistance to Gaza and in reconstruction efforts in the enclave. He added that this would be done ""in full partnership with the Palestinian Authority, not Hamas"".

President Sisi said he had received Mr Biden's phone call with ""utter happiness"", adding that they ""exchanged visions around reaching a formula that would calm the current conflict between Israel and Gaza""."
